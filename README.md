# Flutter Advanced Boilerplate

This boilerplate was created to help developers who come from the JS environment and React.
It is based on :
  - [Fluro](https://github.com/theyakka/fluro), a library similar to react-navigation with React Native but smarter.
  - [Redux for dart](https://pub.dev/packages/redux) which is combined with the package below
  - [Redux for fluter](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_redux)
